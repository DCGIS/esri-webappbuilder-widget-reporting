**Esri Web AppBuilder Reporting Widget**

The purpose of the reporting widget is to give the user the ability to export a report of address points based on three types of queries; select by geometry, select by date (field is configurable through the Web AppBuilder configuration interface), and by status (also configurable through the Web AppBuilder configuration interface).  The reporting fields for both CSV and PDF export formats can be configured separately through the builder interface.

Currently supported upload export formats include:
* CSV
* PDF

This widget uses the PDFMake library for PDF formatting and exporting: [http://pdfmake.org/#/](http://pdfmake.org/#/)
